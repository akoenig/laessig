# laessig

Laessig (a german word (lässig) which stands for 'casual') is a small tool belt which provides helpers for your day-to-day work with the css preprocessor [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

## Installation

In order to install 'laessig' you need a working [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) environment. Please consider the great documentation in the [Node.js Github-Wiki](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki) for a brief explanation about the installation steps.

You have to install ''laessig'' with root privileges via the NPM package system:

    $ sudo npm install laessig -g

## Commands

I've talked about a small tool belt, well, currently there is one command, but, a very important one. Maybe there will be more commands in the future. Let me know if you need a functionality in the context of working with LESS :)

### Observe

Observes a defined directory. If a less file changed, ''laessig'' will compile it into the respective css file.

**Usage:**

    $ laessig observe /the/path/to/your/less/files

## Important!
Enjoy! :)
